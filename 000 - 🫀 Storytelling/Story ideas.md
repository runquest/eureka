## Brief

- Who's your audience? Who you are talking to?
- What are their needs? What do they care about?
- What are you trying to achieve? What do you want people to do?

Empathy is hard. 
There is another angle, sometimes it feels that I am working hard to connect and understand the others but I do not get same back. I feel depleted and angry. 

Through questions we explain that we care and that we understand

"Be curious not furious"
"You cannot be what you cannot see"

8 ways to be curious *not* furious

- Ask "what did you think about ...?"
- Ask "how did you... ?"
- Ask "what else happened... ?"
- Ask "why do you think... ?"
- Say "interesting, I want to hear more..."
- Say "tell me more..."
- Say "and after that, then what happened"
- Say "wow, that's a tough situation, what did you do"


It is interesting how we all talk about important empathy and curiosity is, and then whenever I run into people their comfort zone seems to be to talk about themselves. There's not even *and you, what did you think about this?*

I don't known, when you grow up in a white Catholic conservative household. it sounds I am privileged and empathy means - i feel sorry for you.




Think of a time you empathized with another person or group of people. How did empathizing impact you? The group? What insights did you gather once you stepped into someone else's shoes?


I was talking to a peer. He was frustrated, that leadership has not made a decision yet and this is prevents his team's progress. Which was true. However, in an effort to empathize with his frustration, I attempted to remind him of the situation that leadership team was in, I reminded him where their focus actually is and why he was given a role himself. I tried to arose his empathy with the leadership that he could see an opportunity. 

We worked through his thoughts on what the decision should be, and what data points and risk scenarios would be in leadership team's radar so he could address them in advance. Instead of waiting for leadership to land their decisions on him, we worked another way around and developed a proposal that only needed leadership team's yes or no answer. 

Then he just needed to walk leadership through his thorough thinking process. Empathizing with leadership he managed to cook a meal, so they just needed to chew and swallow. 

I feel we always speak of empathy from the power position. But what if we started talking about empathy upwards, will that make us realize that we are all humans just trying to stay a float and do our best.
