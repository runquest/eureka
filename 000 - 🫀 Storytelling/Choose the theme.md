From the categories below, choose one area that brings to mind a story you're excited to tell.

**Show Me the Money**

Being a creative leader can be challenging, stressful, and taxing. Even with the most rock solid of teams, you still might find yourself needing more support. More staff. More money. More time. More productivity. It's all part of the process. Maybe you're getting a startup off the ground, and your team is spread too thin. How might you tell a compelling story that convinces your funder to invest more money so that you can bring on new talent? Using words, paint the picture of what you need and why you need it.

**My Time to Shine**

Talking about yourself is hard. You don't want to sound too boastful or too bashful. You have to strike the right balance—and fast. Think of it as an elevator pitch of your abilities and core identity. You have your boss's or manager's attention for thirty seconds (or until you reach the top floor). Where do you start? What main points do you need to make?

Write the story that will compel your boss or manager to take action—in this case, empowering you to take on new responsibilities.

**I Have a Dream**

Creative leaders of the world spark change in bold and innovative ways. Whether you're trying to find new opportunities for conserving water or fighting to spread awareness and create solutions around homelessness in your city, you've got to tell a story that inspires others to join your cause, back you monetarily, or mobilize around your ideas. What's your world-changing idea? Get people excited about it and tell a story that motivates change.

**Craft Your Own**

Are you working on a pitch that needs a compelling story? Now's your chance to get early feedback and buy-in before that story goes out into the world and reaches a larger audience.
