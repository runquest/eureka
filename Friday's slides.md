So last week I attended 3 days VIPSS 2024. 
Pretty heavy line up 
- Head, Canadian Centre for Cyber Security
- Privacy Commissioner of Canada
- Field CTO, Cybersecurity, Cisco Canada
- Director, National Security, Amazon Web Services (AWS) International Public Sector

to mention a few. 

Theme of this years even was Guarding Privacy, Fortifying Security: Navigating the AI Frontier. 

And as title suggests major conversations were around: 

- Bill C-27 // what about it?
- Data use in developing LLMs 
- The use of AI for cybersecurity attacks

I walked through the event having Molecular You glasses. Really trying to extract resources, frameworks and ideas for our use cases, and how can we be running at the most optimal speed while maintaining good security posture. 

One extremely useful thing I left is a list of questions that leadership team should be asking to make sure that we are in a good place. 

- What is our current threat landscape
- Do we have a comprehensive security strategy in place
- How do we identify and prioritize risks
- What measures do we have in place to protect sensitive data
- How do we ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards
- What is our incident response plan
- Do we regularly assess and update our security controls
- How do we monitor our systems for security threats
- Are our employees adequately trained in cybersecurity awareness
- What measures do we have in place to secure third-party vendors and partners
- How do we handle security in our software development lifecycle
- How do we ensure the security of our cloud infrastructure and services





To tell the truth in the past I heavily relied on Sitender, then on Vlad to make sure tell me that we are "protected". In December we established Illuminati group that is still trying to find it's grounds and we have Kobalt that sort of / kind of keeps an eye on us.
