### Week 1: Focus Position

Strive to play IP (In Position) as often as possible. Position is power as it gives you:

• More information to act with.
• More time to think about the situation and your opponent.
• Continued positional pressure on later streets against your opponent.

Play 10 sessions with a positional Tick Sheet – In Position or Out Of Position . Goal: more IP than OOP.
Study 5 sessions – Filter for OOP on Flop and review 10-15 losing hands to find your mistakes.

**Current stats in Poker Tracker 4**
212 Hands Played
55 Hands won (25.94%)

I Played in Position - 19 hands
I Played out of Position - 31 hands 

Now I am curious how many hands *In Position* I won - 14 (73.68%)
Now I am curious how many hands *Out of Position* I won - 20 (64.52%)

Okay I think I figured out how to track learning ranges. 

>> Poker Tracker >> View Stats >> Statistics >> Holdem Hand Range Visuallizer >> Range >> Position

So it appears that my range of Button & Cut Off looks like this:

So in the Button I can raise 51% of the time. 
Okay so in current session we are going to aim for in CO + Button position call everything above T8, All Aces + Qsuited.

**Summary 2PM Session on January 13, 2024**
45 minutes - 188 hands played - PFR 15.47 (better than 40)

----
**Notes:**
I played another session but I decided not to over focus on writing down that session results. It can always be looked up. I think what i care more is to see if I am doing better or not. 

So yesterday's goal was to play more *In Position* than *Out of Position*

**Original: stats in Poker Tracker 4**
212 Hands Played - 55 Hands won (25.94%)
IP vs OOP: 19 / 31 = 61%

IP vs OOP: 137 / 247 = 55% 
// note that there are many more hands to play. I am comparing BTN + CO vs. SB, BB, UTG, MP.
// Than I guess questions is how many hands I played in each of the positions?

##### 2024-01-12 Conclusion
* I am playing more hands in position than out of position
* I am playing too many hands and my VPIP should drop a bit
* Yesterday's OPP game was better, cause Middle positions were more profitable. 
* I need to improve my game on BB and SB. 
* Continue practicing ranges for BTN, CO and keep it really tight in the Middle position.
