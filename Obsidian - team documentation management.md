### Category: Decisions

Documents in this section should declare the conclusion at the top. 

Is this more of a proposal document? And then from proposal we can go ahead into the decision? 

So really metadata at the top:

* Date
* Stakeholders
* Tags
* Ticket (if exists)
* Question? Problem?
* Decision:

And then the body of the document we are discussing thought process for our decision making and how we arrive the a conclusion.


Features. Should they have links to tickets? hmm... to confluence? it makes sense at the moment.
