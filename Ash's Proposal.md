Ash's document:
-> what other samples where considered?

-> *current diagnostic methods often identify risk factors too late for effective intervention.* 
Is CVD not tightly correlated to lifestyle and easy to predict by BMI, etc. 

-> *We will also have a difficult time acquiring CVD samples through our clinical partners.* why are we making this assumption?

-> Should we not be seeking to help our partners with more challenging Brain Health Issues?

-> Are we quoting papers that are 20 years old? **Yusuf et al., 2004**

-> What are we going to do with those samples?

-> So we are getting samples of sick people right? 


**Study**

So we are taking people who have risk factors
We follow up after a year 

*What if none of them have anything happen?*

Control group is samples with low risk factors? how do we know that from our samples?
