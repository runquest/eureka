> Once the parts connect and are relevant, that is information. When you start to apply information, you have knowledge. And when you can juggle with the knowledge and create your own knowledge, then it becomes wisdom.

## Learning
- [[single loop learning]]
- [[double loop learning]]
- [[neurological level]]

Knowledge has to be a system - the whoel is greater than the sum of its parts.

*Your car is a heap when it does not work; it's just a collection of parts. All the parts are there, but because they are not connected in the right way, none of it works. It only takes one part to go wrong and the whole system will not work.*

**Systems thinking is the art and science of understanding how a system opeerates. You can apply systems thinking to any system, physical, social, living or mechanical.**

[[First Order Change]] is when you achieve a single outcome - a different response in a particular context. NLP Techniques for the *first order* change:
- [[simple reframing]]
- [[anchoring]]
- [[new behaviour generator]]
- [[change personal history]]
- [[visual/kinesthetic dissociation (phobia process)]]
- [[future pacing]]

[[First Order Change]] is the result of a [[single loop learning]]. It works with bounded, structured problems. 

A bounded problem has a finite set of poossible solutions.
A structured problem is phrased unambiguously in a way that makes the problem clear and points the way to a solution.

[[First Order change]] is where the change is not necessarily meant to be generative and the immediate side-effects are minimal and can be ignored for practical purposes.

[[Second Order Change]] is when there are multiple outcomes and secondary considerations in the change. The change has to be generative, developing the ability to make other changes.

[[Second order change]] is allied to [[double loop learning]]. NLP Techniques that can lead to second order change: 
* [[six-step reframing]]
* [[systemic interventions on the levels of language, physiology and thinking]]
* [[perceptual position alignment]]
* [[metaphor]]
* [[strategies]]

Second order change is needed for *unbounded, unstructured problems*.
