Neurological levels all connect to each other and all influence each other. 

Neurological levels separate the deed from the person. **You are not your behaviour.**

Useful for outcome setting.
*You can specify your outcomes by:*
- the sort of environment you want
- how you want to act
- what skills you want
- what attitudes and beliefs you want to adopt
- what sort of person you want to be

[[Outcome thinking]] is a skill - an approach you take to all the decisions you make. It aligns with you beliefs and values when you see how well it works and when it becomes an important principle in your life. It reaches the identity level when you become the sort of person who moves towards what you want in your life instead of leaving it chace or for other people to decide.

## Neurological Levels

### 1 Environment
*the where and the when*
The environment is the place, the time and the people involved. You set the boundary on what to include. You may be successful only in specific circumstances or with particular people - *being in the right place at the right time*

### 2 Behaviour
*the what*
Behaviour is what we do - thoughts and actions. 
Difficult to change as it is closely connected to other levels.

### 3 Capability
*the how*
Capability is skill - behaviour that is consistent, automatic and habitual. This level includes both thinking strategies and physical skills. 

In organization - business processes & procedures. Visible only in the resulting behaviour.

### 4 Beliefs and values
*the why*

Beliefs are the principles that guide actions. Beliefs give meaning to what we do. Values are why we do what we do. They are what is important to us - health, wealth, happiness and love. 

In organization - business have principles they act on and values they hold. 

They are part of the culture of the business. Beliefs and values direct our lives, acting both as permissions and prohibitions on how we act.

### 5 Identity
*the who*

Identity is your sense of yourself, the core beliefs and values that define you and your mission in life. It is built throughout your life and is very resilient. 
We express ourselves through our behaviour, skills, beliefs and values, but we are more than all or any of these.

In business, organizational identity is the business culture. It emerges from the interaction of the other levels.

### 6 Beyond identity
*connection*

This is the realm of ethics, religion and spirituality - your place in the world.

In business - vision and how the business connects with the community and other organizations.

## The Language of Neurological Levels

You can tell what level a person is thinking on by listening to the words they say and where they put stress on.
e.g. *can't do that here*

You can use Neurological Levels to explore a problem, or when you are confused and uncertain what to do. Once you know what level you are stuck on, you know what sort of resources you need.

* *Environment*: Do you need more information about the situation
* *Behaviour*: Do you have enough information, but do not know exactly what to do?
* *Capability*: Do you know what to do, but doubt your ability to do it?
* *Beliefs & values*: Do you know that you havev the ability, but not want to do it or not think it is important?
* *Identity*: Do you feel that it is a worthwhile thing to do, but somehow it's just **not you**?
