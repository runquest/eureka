Generative learning brings our beliefs and assumptions about the issue into the feedback loop. Feedback from our actions leads us to questioni our assumptions. 

**Questions to ask:** 
* What are my assumptions about this?
* How else could I think about this?
* How might my assumptions be contributing to the problem?
* How come this situation has persisted?
