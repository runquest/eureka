AWS global architecture refers to the underlying infrastructure and network design of Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables it to provide highly available, scalable, and reliable cloud computing services to its customers worldwide.

AWS global architecture comprises of several interconnected regions, each consisting of multiple availability zones (AZs). Each region is a separate geographic location with multiple data centers, and each AZ is a distinct physical facility, with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, within a region.

The AWS global network also includes edge locations, which are distributed around the world to provide low-latency access to AWS services, and AWS Direct Connect, which provides dedicated network connections between an organization's on-premises infrastructure and AWS.

This global architecture enables AWS customers to deploy their applications and services in multiple regions and AZs, which provides geographic redundancy, fault tolerance, and resiliency to failures. Customers can also use AWS services to automatically replicate their data and resources across multiple regions for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes.
