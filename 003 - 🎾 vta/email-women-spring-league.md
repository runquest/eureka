Greetings ladies, and thanks for submitting your applications. 

Unfortunately we were informed that deadline for pulling together a team for the women's league was September. 
We will certainly be on top of this league next year.
For that to be guarantee we will need at least 10 woman of the same level per team. 
I am myself rather competitive person and would have love to see a mixed teams
