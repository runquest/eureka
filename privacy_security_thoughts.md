So if we are exclusively focus on HIPAA their major concern is to protect ePHI data.

What is ePHI data? // can we say in certainty what it is for us? Classification process (?) @Sagan working on it?


Now the way HIPAA proposes to protect that data is through 17 control groups:


- Asset Management
- Data Classification & Handling
- Identification & Authentication
- Physical & Environmental Security
- Compliance
- Third Party Management
- Business Continuity & Disaster Recover
- Endpoint Security
- Incident Response
- Risk Management
- Security & Privacy Governance
- Maintenance
- Security Awareness & Training
- Cryptogaphic Protection
- Human Resource Security
- Continuous Monitoring
- Secure Engineering & Architecture


Can these groups be grouped even more, by policies it is managed or activities required?
