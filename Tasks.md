##### Questions to explore
- [ ] What is *feeling myself*?

##### TO DO from journal
```dataview
TASK 
FROM "000 - 📝 journal/_daily"
WHERE !completed
WHERE !contains(text, "#daily")
```
---
#### Ideas

tasks can be mine specific to a project and they can come up from meetings, journaling or be reoccurring.
tasks can be the ones that others committed on doing and I want to keep an eye on.
how to publish documentation for everyone to see?
