# Time with mom

I would like it to be quiet time. With cups of team. Nice food for breakfast and dinner with wine. 
Morning yoga, spa and walking / cycling spaces. 

Okay so resort is one option:

If we choose to go and spent 3 days in Montreal. How would that look like?

- taking a train?
- staying in the old Montreal?
- spa?
- art gallery?
- food?

If we choose to go to the island? to Seattlle?
