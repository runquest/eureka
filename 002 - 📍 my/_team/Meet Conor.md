##### Summary for Gene

Just finished conversation with [Conor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorswanson/) 

Seems very legit. Liked the energy and philosophy and would like to see what candidates he can put forward. 

*Code* - is a 12 people company based in Denver, Colorado. They mostly focused on recruiting developers, but work with UI/UX hires, as well as some of executive level people.
Works mostly with Series C and upwards level companies.

They usually work on 20% off first year commission, up on successful hire. Currently offering a "deal" of 15%
90 days probations period - matches us. 

I asked for Senior DevOps in Canada for 120K/year. He said it is possible. 

Next steps: If you approve that cost of successful hire would be 15-20%, I will fire him our job description and see what he can produce. 
If we do not like candidates, we can always withdraw. No exclusivity rights - meaning we can work with other agencies and find people on our own. 

Thoughts?
