### What is on Erick's mind?
* Site Restructuring feature
	* We made a good decision to slow down and rewrite the feature implementation. We ended up with better quality code. 
	* Stress certainly creates tunnel vision which we try to combat, by sharing our thoughts with the team and giving us space to work through it
* Meeting notes
* Documentation - Aiste provided more context in restructured document, but it is a work in progress in terms of developing a template for it
	* [ ] Erick to clean up that document and merge PR notes

### What is on Aiste's mind?

* Where we are at
	* Run through test Mai & Aiste
* Try Github CoPilot for test writing
	* Try writing tests for us and see if that will speed up our work and what is the accuracy 
* ~~Documentation~~
