### What is on Erick's mind?
* Documentation - Aiste provided more context in restructured document, but it is a work in progress in terms of developing a template for it
	* [x] Erick to clean up that document and merge PR notes
* Site management "redesign" for providers
	* may need to do some Production edits
* Late March to Pittsburgh

### What is on Aiste's mind?
* Seed data
	* Relied in seed data on existing  provider - when deleted broke tests
	* Picked up database changes
* Try Github CoPilot for test writing
	* Trying to set up
	* Try writing tests for us and see if that will speed up our work and what is the accuracy 
* I want you to be Skyler - what is your goals for this quarter?
