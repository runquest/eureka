# February 14 - Erick

### On Erick's mind

- Talked to Marc - liked the questioning line
- Performance queries - Aiste shared Ben's plan.
- Seems that scope of Web onboarding is very small
- Improving test coverage

### On Aiste's mind

- Github Co-pilot
	- Not really working out. Plugin is not functional
