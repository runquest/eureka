### What is on Ravneet's mind?
* She talked about the work that is In Progress at the moment and what she is currently working on.
* Requested to take a flex day in January for the 29th when she worked
	* Aiste: Check in with Haiyan it should be reflected in BambooHR
### What is on Aiste's mind?

* Less work in PRs & In Progress. Try to complete tickets before moving forward. Be a bit more assertive to get the work reviewed faster/sooner. 

### Projects

* Consolidate UI
