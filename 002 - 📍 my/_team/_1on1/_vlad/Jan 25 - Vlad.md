### What is on Vlad's mind?
* Work is priority now that school is easy
* Rollback of Penguin - DB + App Deployment
	* We needed to rollback 5 days and Penguin images is not returned - investigating, but not a quick fix that was visible - no point in fixing pipeline for that at the moment
* Epheral environment
	* Seeds broke: working with Erick (2 fixes)
	- [ ] We should recreate environments once a month? #my #aiste
	- Local redirects were broken - fixed with kind of a patch
	- + added pretty domains - for future we will be using ticket numbers for it
* Primary focus: Infrastructure as Code
	* Low response rate from Ben & Skyler on Vlad's PRs
* Ben took back SQS Pulumi project
	* Vlad's surprised that Ben studied on his own time
### What is on Aiste's mind?

- Latest Infrastructure diagram
- AWS Inspector - enable
- VPN renewals - i do not want people coming and saying their internet is not working
