### Projects
##### Database Migrations
Database schema - created two tickets one for MYhi and one for MYnd - schema's between production and staging completely off.
	* Decided: 
	1) Back up environment data; 
	2) Take schema from Production; 
	3) Load production schema 
	4) Load back data
#### Technical Debt
