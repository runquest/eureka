	* 
* Review: https://github.com/molecularyou/mynd/pull/208
* PDF hold report - remove state machine
* SQS complete - Active 

### What is on Aiste's mind - talked about

* I see 8+ tickets in progress
* I know that we promised reports on hold this sprint
* And I see that we have been working on this schema thing for a week +/- now
	* where did motivation for this  came?
		* in preparation for doing changes in regards to reports on hold feature
	* Why is it taking so long
		* MYnd
			* 1-2 days on MYnd
			* 2.5 days of MYhi - higher complexity
			* 1 Planning - report hold
			* Tuesday unproductive
