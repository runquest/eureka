### What is on Ben's mind?


### What is on Aiste's mind - talked about

- [x] PDF Reports is a bit of disappointment... 1 month over the deadline and started to months ago. 
- [x] Taking time off on vacation when there was work to be done - need more output from Ben
- Got into Christmas mood and did not work for 2 days between Christmas
- Team needs more output from Ben
### Projects
##### Learnings from Health Report PDF project

- Documentation originally should have been more clear - clarifying how we test things, where do we see things, how we communicate
- Overall better project management
- Addressing above with: Documentation first initiative 
- If December 9th would have been do or die deadline our solution would have been to install [pupetter](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/) and node dependencies on our local server.
	- Having more time to understand *Lambda* we have less dependencies now, which is healthier for the platform
- Ben had too much ownership and at times felt overwhelmed. 
	- Aiste should have pushed more responsibility on Vlad sooner. There was no time on playing / learning at that stage.
#### Technical Debt
* Update Health Report model with Display + Unit object
