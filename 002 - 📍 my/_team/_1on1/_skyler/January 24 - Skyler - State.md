### What is on Topics?

Discussed multiple topics from product development process, to salary increase to individual developer performance and growth strategy. 

**Key thoughts:**

-> How to grow Erick to be *Skyler* on Experience team. What does Erick need?
	- A bigger picture. And impact to overall. 
	- Potentially guiding implementation of Onboarding 3.0 on the web
-> Data project still lacks guidance plan and direction
-> Everything takes time and iteration - we will revisit Product / Development sync meeting to check in about the wins and improvements of new process
-> Set of tools that Skyler wants team to use: airtable, apacheset, etc. there is no uptake... But really it is just a poor way of showcasing capabilities and applications of these tools.
