### On Skyler's mind

**Thoughts after xmas drinks:** 

Let's have a conversation with Product team to align to start the year on the right foot: 

	* Pen to paper
	* Escalation & accountability
		* Escalation path was not clear:
		* Suggestion: Plans -> Skyler identify issues -> Skyler + PM -> Skyler + PM + Aiste
	* PM is "boss" if something
	* PM needs to be more demanding on deadline

### On Aiste's Mind

[Skyler filter](https://molecularyou.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10020)

* Do  we have tickets for Ravneet's work?
	- [ ] Create Epic & Add tickets for Ravneet
* Feedback on Ravneet? 
	* Poor communication
		* Takes long time to update
		* Unclear on when she is online
		* Responses are just thumbs up without much follow up
	* Simple changes takes long - can we see practical things?
* Loving all the sharing - what can we do with it? 
	* Would like to see people try out new things
	* Can we add an expectation that to grow as a developer you need to step out of your comfort zone and see how other are doing things
* What support he needs on Permissions & Roles
	* Has a prototype
	* Trying to solve a problem on how to manage roles per different user types
	* We can transition step by step per user groups and adjust policies
