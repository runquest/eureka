	How do we want to work together? 
		- Skyler: If you want me to whip into shape developers, I need you to work tightly with Product Managers.   
	Ask these at some point: 
	*Do you enjoy working together?
	*What do you appreciate the most?*
	*What do you think can be better?*

Make it simple, clear and transparent.
