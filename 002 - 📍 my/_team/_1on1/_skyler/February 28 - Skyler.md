- Ravneet? Complete the UI consolidation? 
	- Yeah progress is being made, missing:
		- Admin login
		- reports - confirmed with Brandon
		- projects - confirmed with Mai
- Seems that she is pulled off from that task? Ask about the "challenge" that Skyler gave

-> 

- Evolving roles - projects, teams, deliverables
- Gather together - Once a week? Once a month?
