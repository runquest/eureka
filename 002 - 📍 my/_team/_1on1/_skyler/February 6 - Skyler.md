### What is on Topics?

Discussed multiple topics from product development process, to salary increase to individual developer performance and growth strategy. 

**Key thoughts:**

-> LLM Problem + Science portal - lack of data problem. Best approach to sell the LLM machine and buy biobank samples
-> Authority problem - unplugging Vlad will bring Ben in to the team // the worst thing that we can do is keep DevOps away from product team
-> Take advantage of grants + personal development budgets
-> Meeting with Gene
