### To-Do

* All physical technology assets and assets associated with PHI, PII and de-identified health data and its processing facilities that store, process, or transmit classified information shall be identified, recorded and managed by the Security Team
* Maintain list of computer inventory:
	*All details of the device, including operating system, update status, model number, serial number, computer name, etc. will be collected and retained by the Security Team through the asset management process

	**Decide**
	List of computers:
	- [Endpoint Inventory List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zuQTTi2smoeUvhfPq9myRqAGXG8OLGAs/edit#gid=397013037)
	- [Sophos](https://central.sophos.com/manage/overview/dashboard)
	- [Vanta](https://app.vanta.com/computers)
	- [GSuit](https://admin.google.com/ac/devices/list?default=all)
	*Questions:* better tooling?
	*Comments:* 
	- What do we need to do
	- Is there other devices that we run PHI, PII or de-identified health data on?

* Company devices and media that have been used to store or process confidential data shall be securely disposed of when no longer needed.
	- There is an *NIST standard* - read and pull 
	* What is the process right now?
* Data must be erased prior to disposal or re-use, using an approved technology in order to ensure that data is not recoverable.








#### Task
- [ ] identifying information of the computer (i.e. serial numbers) will be connected to the information of the employee to which it was issued
- [ ] what software does it for us? Where is the location of such list? How do we keep it up to date? is it Sophos?

Sophos should:
- Enforce chosen policies
- show which assets meet security requirements
- are encrypted
- do not meet standards
- enforce role-based security policies for user groups based on functional groups
- push notifications of necessary updates or required changes to affected devices
- allows to remotely erase or lock a lost or stolen asset 


### Good to know
* Report lost assets immediately
