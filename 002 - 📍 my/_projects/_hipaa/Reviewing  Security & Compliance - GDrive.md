First going through **Security * Compliance** shared drive. 

* Created *Archive* folder to place everything I do not think we need, as I do not want to delete anything. 
* I am also essentially looking for templates, guidelines and records that would be relevant to us. 

ONLY 3 people have access to Security & Compliance Drive: 
- Aiste - Manager
- Rob - Contributor
- Vlad - Contributor

I actually do not think we utilize this drive at all. It seems to have been used formerly. We could use this storing Guidelines or Instructions and maybe some lists? But does everyone get access to it?... 

[This is a good reminder of Okta and account access](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jA7b8FUfneksVRV0JrZzS-phKbvtFrwSomkroYWkk1A/edit#slide=id.gbc5c786f88_0_48)

Maybe here we can store Incident reports, or any other reports. But who should access to that in this case?

- [ ] Ask Fred: Is there a need to pull down spreadsheets on a regular basis of usage/logging ? #iluminati 
- [ ] Ask Haiyan: Why barcodes on laptops? #iluminati 
- [ ] Ask Haiyan: Microsoft 365 users tracking why? #iluminati 
- [ ] What do we have in our MYDrive for security & privacy + training #iluminati 

I am thinking I can archive that entire drive. What I learned from it a potential structure and what we may need to keep track of. 

- Guidelines
- Templates
- Vendor Assessments
- Access Logs that we upload to Vanta
- Inventory
- Incident Reports
- Vendor Research 
- Training Materials

p.s. Consider Vanta for Auditor's quick view.
