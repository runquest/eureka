### Biggest projects
#### Application & Platform upgrade in June
We had incredible collaboration among the team and a few risks we took paid off. 
#### Launch of Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI / CD) Pipeline
This speeds up feature releases into staging for testing, consistency and frequency of our production releases and visibility into the features being deployed and running on production.
#### Launch of Data project 
It was not only a financially big investment but it provided the team with quite a big learning opportunity of data handling, our security practices and data analysis.
#### QA Automation
We have reduced the number of people that need to get involved and also are taking advantage of Lambda services that in the future will save us money also. 
#### Mobile development
Release of two time point comparison & full onboarding on mobile app
