#### The Business Case for Privacy by Design: ISO31700 Use Case
##### Oskar Trpisovsky, Senior Manager, Privacy, Regulatory & Information Management, KPMG

Privacy is a universqal right and non-negotiable.

Privacy Law Reform
Digital Ethics
Public Cloud Adoption
Open Data - consider value data change

-> Consent

Privacy is gonna slow us down.
If done write it will speeds us up. 
-> there is the reason that fastest cars in the world has breaks, that you could go faster

??? 

Why are you doing it this way?

!! Learn GDPR principles
-> in Europe everything is not okay - and why is it okay to do so?
-> everywhere else - everything is okay - and law tells you why it is not okay


If it is not written and it is not documented - it is not done. 
If I don't have any evidence of it, I do not trust you.

TRUST

We did risk assessment

#### How do you have conversation with board
- if they are not taking things seriously, whose job is it and how do you do it?

-> Educate
-> Tremendous vectors of compromise
-> As brief as possible, sweet spot of what they want to see
-> Use same format

-> Ensure there is no surprises
-> You are not trying to make them experts. You want to point out to specific risks (customer trust, etc.)
-> What legislative decisions are coming out - *Ask Ritchie on those suggestions*

**! Incident response plan; And it is rehearsed; !**
**! Table top exercise **

#### How do you get through a CEO?
* CEO did not see the need to put it board agenda

-> My job is to protect the CEO

- [ ] Build a 3 year cyberplan and show how you move through it
- [ ] Consider external auditors - how can they do due dilligence
- [ ] Conduct Table top exercise at all levels of exercises
- [ ] Focused about tracking and reporting the risk we have
- [ ] Speak to the board in their language - risks, finance, etc. 


*why do we keep Privacy & Security in a single sentence / team. Can we split that responsibility. For me one is about policing, another one about design. Well maybe both is about design and policing, but those are different topics for me.*
