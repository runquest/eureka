#### How do you have conversation with board
- if they are not taking things seriously, whose job is it and how do you do it?

-> Educate
-> Tremendous vectors of compromise
-> As brief as possible, sweet spot of what they want to see
-> Use same format

-> Ensure there is no surprises
-> You are not trying to make them experts. You want to point out to specific risks (customer trust, etc.)
-> What legislative decisions are coming out - *Ask Ritchie on those suggestions*

**! Incident response plan; And it is rehearsed; !**
**! Table top exercise **

#### How do you get through a CEO?
* CEO did not see the need to put it board agenda

-> My job is to protect the CEO

- [ ] Build a 3 year cyberplan and show how you move through it
- [ ] Consider external auditors - how can they do due dilligence
- [ ] Conduct Table top exercise at all levels of exercises
- [ ] Focused about tracking and reporting the risk we have
- [ ] Speak to the board in their language - risks, finance, etc. 


*why do we keep Privacy & Security in a single sentence / team. Can we split that responsibility. For me one is about policing, another one about design. Well maybe both is about design and policing, but those are different topics for me.*
