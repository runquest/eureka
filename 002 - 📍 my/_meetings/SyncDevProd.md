### Purpose

In December we made certain promises and set certain processes around it. 
Things such as - Product Managers should feel empowered by the team, the steps of escalation, shrinking the gap between feature design + implementation. 

We are in 2 sprints into this process and I want for us to review what is going well and what adjustments should we make, and experiments we can run?

### Outcome 

So I would like to leave today's meeting with at least 3 items in each category:

- Stop
- Continue
- Start

### Process

In terms of the process I suggest we review last 4 projects that we worked on this month: 
1) Health Report Dashboard
2) Site Restructure
3) Demo Reports
4) Consolidating UI

In Progress

5) Report Hold Feature 
6) Health Score HotFix
7) LLM 
8) Science Portal
