### Try for January 8th

* Structure to agenda
* During the week communicate ownership (no hot potato - we are full stack developers)
* Setup ability to review JIRA - and walk each team member through it (?) - set expectations
* Ask Erick to own notes - Download Obsidian - Create pull request for meetings
	* Agenda
	* Action points
	* Decisions made

##### Topics

* Quality of the code - We do not have QA - we are responsible for putting out quality features - test local, test on staging, test when released in production - ownership
* Epics start with documentation from PM + Implementation PR from developer
* Full-stack developers - clarify what and how during implementations phase
* Principles - Code tests, Business logic in the backend



## Reflection on January 2
### What went well? 
+ I was late to join and team was interacting

### What tickles me:
* no questions after
* people look disengaged
* lack of specifics... i felt like i was speaking into the air. I should learn to tell a better story.

So you mean it was not perfect.
Needs better agenda and someone else needs to be driving it.
