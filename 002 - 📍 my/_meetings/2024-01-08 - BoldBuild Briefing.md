### Thoughts





### ❗️Bring up January 15th
##### Topics

* Quality of the code - We do not have QA - we are responsible for putting out quality features - test local, test on staging, test when released in production - ownership
* Epics start with documentation from PM + Implementation PR from developer
* Full-stack developers - clarify what and how during implementations phase
* Principles - Code tests, Business logic in the backend

## Reflection on January 8
 Had structure. But forgot to review. It went smoother, but felt a bit dry and I still felt all the pressure. Though I feel Erick's attention was on the activities.


## Reflection on January 2
### What went well? 
+ I was late to join and team was interacting

### What tickles me:
* no questions after
* people look disengaged
* lack of specifics... i felt like i was speaking into the air. I should learn to tell a better story.

So you mean it was not perfect.
Needs better agenda and someone else needs to be driving it.
