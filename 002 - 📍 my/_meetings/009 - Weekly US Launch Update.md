#### Topic: OKRs for 2024
----
##### Tasks
- [ ] Summarize *end of year* event #my 
- [ ] Do we have dummy accounts in production? #my 
- [ ] Help Joe with People's OKRs
##### Thoughts
- People's OKRs are uninspiring, vague, and not really thought through
- Finding product market fit is a great OKR, however there are too many team related Key Results, that it is unmanageable. 
- I thought that signing a contract with Labs should go under FinOps goal, as it is directly related for us running business
- Also I do not agree with removing FInOps as a goal just because KR under it is very day to day. We should our question why are we doing these day to day? To what end? what is our next milestone on this.
