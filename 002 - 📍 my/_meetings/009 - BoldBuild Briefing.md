### What went well? 
+ I was late to join and team was interacting
+ 




### What tickles me:
* no questions after
* people look disengaged
* lack of specifics... i felt like i was speaking into the air. I should learn to tell a better story.

So you mean it was not perfect.
Needs better agenda and someone else needs to be driving it.
