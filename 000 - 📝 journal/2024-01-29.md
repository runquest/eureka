#### Thoughts

I am excited I have energy, I am very me. 
I want to do things, I have ideas, but execution is continuously an issue. It's almost like I hate technology... there is always something lacking, something broke, something misconfigured. It is never as easy as just running a command and things working out. 

I need to slow down. I need to get clear what I want. 

*MY Knowledge Platform | MY Wiki*

We want to write documentation in markdown language. âœ…
I should be able to generate a static site for it with things linking properly

I should be able to publish it into AWS behind the VPN wall
I should be able to generate pages for review on PRs

Physio was excellent. Feel like a ton of weight was unloaded off my lower back. 
Now I need to build up on it. I should go through each of my joints, muscles and patters. Figure out their ROM and muscle strength as well as development and needed stimuli.

**3:27PM** 

Finished Kobalt.io - Security & Privacy meeting and coming out deflated and angry with little to no motivation. 
Very unsatisfying. Still have 2-3 hours of work to do, but do not even know where to start. 

Gonna try to disconnect from that thought and communication and engage in something more productive.
