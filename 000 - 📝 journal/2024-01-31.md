#### Thoughts

And we began... 2 cans of beer in the office, bottle of wine with dinner and movie, a shot of mezcal for a good night sleep. 

Slept deep. Felt like deep quality sleep. 
Hard to wake up. Well it was hard to wake the day I did not drink too. 

Anyways, while head is okay - digestion system is certainly unhappy about last nights activities. 

I am less angry today. I am actually not angree today at all. 
Maybe my mornings are not angry at all it just meetings that trigger me. Emotional self regulation?

My brain is fully fixated on my back and inability to do things. 

I am an adult. I am an adult.
