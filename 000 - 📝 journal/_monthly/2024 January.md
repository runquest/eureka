### 1. “At what point in this month do I feel the happiest?”

*Playing tennis.* 
My pain was not worse than usual, but moving on the court and remembering how to hit the ball gave me so much joy.

*Lunch with Joe*
It felt very freeing to leave home midday and drive to have a long lunch while catching up talking about work and not drinking once head off. 

*Urban Hike - Bread-eries*
It was relaxing to move through the *urban* landscape and discover new scenes. 

*Other*
- I enjoyed working through 52Frames project
- I enjoyed diagraming Data Team project ideas
- I enjoyed reading and learning more about HIPAA controls from Vanta
- I enjoyed my time with Abby when I would just drop in for the afternoon - that Sunday even though it was pissing rain was probably best Sunday - Abby -> Tennis
### 2. “What is the biggest mistake I did this month (and what I learned from it)?”

Biggest mistake?... 

Not controlling my anger - snapping at Rachel a few times. I am saying it is chronic pain that is causing me, and a sense of helplessness, but then instead of stopping and figuring things out I am continue to work, sit on the couch and be scared to workout. 

Allowing work to be my priority. I really feel work is my playground and I have friends and that I will get some sort of approval for doing things well. Partially true, partially not really... 

### 3. “What is my biggest accomplishment this month?”

- 28 days *clean* this month
- 20 Big 3 Back habits
- Finishing building out *Sounding Board* website

----

### “What went right and what went wrong?”

- Who did I spend time with that made me feel good (or bad)?
		*Good:* Lindsay - after we had lunch i left feeling calm. And I cannot explain why. It was not a confidence boost, I did not feel heard, but I felt calm and relaxed.
		*Bad*: work people - i feel I for some reason am battling them. 
- Did I accomplish anything I’m proud of this month?
		Not in particular... 28 days clean was a struggle, but I am happy about it. I am also happy with my back exercise consistency, now I just would like to feel better. 
- What habits did I make, break, or maintain?
		back exercises
		walking
		making smoothie my breakfast
		writing daily in obsidian
		aiming to cook for me and Rachel every other day - helped me break off the negative cycle from the day, gave me a pause and focus on different area, also made me contribute to our relationship more
- When did I feel most/least like myself?
		*most* how Abby would say ...*shiiiit*... I do not know... It was not tennis court - i was playing a role there. work... i feel my truths and sharing is to form relationship and build trust, i do not know if that is myself. Also continues pain does not allow me to be myself fully. Now I am even questioning what is that *self*....
		What is *myself*? I think active, honest, high standards, high quality, compassionate, generous, that is how I want to see myself. Oh Matt and I had great Friday night playing *cook off* on nintendo while he did laundry. Maybe that was most myself, but even then I feel I was a bit pretend. 
		i feel constantly that I am playing a role, and I need to be a certain way to protect myself, to not disappoint another person, to keep on track... but *myself* does not mean let go, maybe you are those things that you imagine you are acting out? 
- When did I have the most/least energy?
		I derived a plan to eat under 2K calories, walk 10K, 30 minutes cardio, breakfast, genuine human connection, read - it seems to energize me or at least make me happy. 
		I took a day off, but i did not feel energized
		I like working - i feel energized at work when I am clear what I want
		I feel energized when I am in deep work
		I feel energized after a workout
		I felt energized after tennis game
		Everything opposite drained me... 
- What projects did I work on that I was excited about?
		Sounding Board landing page, until I got scared
		Work environment seems save... as if someone to catch me if I am doing wrong things, working on wrong things, and i can justify that I am getting paid for things I do even if they are not right things.... 
		But really excited? Even photography did not give so much joy, I should have allowed myself more space to dive deeper, experiment more, learn more, try more, just play in that space. 
- What places did I find myself gravitating towards?
		couch
		coffee shop
		time by myself with my thoughts
- Which to-do list items were on my list at the beginning of the month…and are still there?
		So many of them. Makes me think that I had too many to think about. Maybe take away is to shorten the list... to reorganize - important / urgent and not. Maybe brainstorming ideas should live somewhere else instead of just naming things. 
- Did I make progress on any big goals?
		My biggest goals for this year is health and business. I did not make big progress, but I made some in both. In health - sticking to back exercise routine, reaching out for more structured and frequent pilates training, staying clean. in business - setting up landing page and talking about our plans with Lindsay. I still believe we can make big progress there. 

### 2. What can I do differently?

- **How can I get more of the good?** 
		For one I need to try and stick with good habits of January:
			- clean + movement
			- cooking + reflecting
			- connecting + reading
		Both Rachel and I noticed that not turning on TV after work makes our evenings much more pleasant 
		I found that losing myself in a book makes me recharge for the next day
- **How can I get less of the bad?** 
		I need to chill out and make work - just be work. I've started created system, but I feel as it gets busy and more impact I have the more chaotic it gets. I need to learn to slow down and really let myself dive deep in certain areas. 
		If i can develop a better improvement plan for my health - a better preparation for Spring tennis season the happier I will be. 
- **How can I change the bad into good?** 
		TV -> book
		Pain -> movement
		Chaos -> space
### 3. What are my top 3 priorities for the coming month?






- **Tie them into your previous answers.** 
- **Limit yourself.** 3 is a great number for me, but you can do more or less, as long as the number you end up with is realistic for you.
- **Remind yourself of them.** Keep your priorities in the forefront of your mind by setting reminders on your phone, hanging a sign on your bathroom mirror, etc. It could also be helpful to ask a friend or partner to have weekly check ins with you about your priorities.
