#### Thoughts

Something is just not sitting right. Something just feels very uncomfortable. 

Yesterday felt stressful. It is as if I am carying responsibility of all the meetings, and making sure that everyone feels happy and productive in a meeting, and I am not wasting anyone's time. 

What do you want to get gold star for? 
Being organized? Being insightful?
Building happy and productive teams?

Everything is just fighting for your time and space. 
What is taking priority? 
I am not going to say wrong things. Documentation, meetings are not the wrong things, I just wish I am capable of completing a task. Fully emerging myself into a project. 

This is all bullshit. Same song on repeat. Viscious circle with no resolution.
What do you want to build? 

Today is a free day. 
Yesterday was a free day. 

I still very much feel in control of it all. 
That is what is weird. I feel in control. It is almost I am hiding behind that wall. 

I am important. I matter. I have impact. 

Freedom. 
I want light, happy, creative, excited world around me. 

I am a vibration. This is my world. I create reality.
