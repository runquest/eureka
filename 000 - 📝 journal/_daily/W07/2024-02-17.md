#### Thoughts

Where do I begin.
Too big to handle? Too big to ignore. Too big not to care.

There is a moment here. A somewhat defining moment. 
I am getting by. I am getting through. But I am doing same thing over and over and over again.
Over and over again.
Over and over again. 
But to what means. For what purpose.
Externally I justify every move, every phone call. 
But it is accomplishing?
Making me feel "big"? "important"?
Maintain status quo.

I am having fun. I am living easy. 
Why why why why.
Running in circles. Asking questions to avoid answering them.
