#### Thoughts

Part of me wants to fix all the "*wrongs*" of last week... Apologize, amend, complete. 
But I am also not entirely sold on the thought that it will help, what will I achieve with it? Is that the very typical thinking that we (? who is we)  should avoid. 

I always show up to our team meetings feeling incredibly unprepared with so much to say and so much to follow up. That's the problem of important non-important. 

I am observing Rob, Gene, Ash even Shannon - to be working with no artifacts, with no rule setting, without writing things down. Am I wasting my time on that. Am I just busying for the sake of busying or they are doing things differently? What does Andrius do? Ilma writes it all down. 

Stream of thoughts. 
Slow and organized. Dispassionate. Straight to the point. Thoughts? Ideas? Feels a bit more of the same. 

Launching *Sb* seems to have opened up a platform or a door to allow myself to write my own thoughts. To do something more. I am going to capitalize on that to build my brand. Through examples of VTA, Illuminati, MY Team, previous life examples. 

I need a validation from somewhere that I gave Vlad all the opportunity.
