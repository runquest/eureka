### Journal
#### Morning thoughts
Way too much time on TV and way too much time in bed this morning. 
I spend my days trying to focus on focus that I feel way too accomplished and not rushed, but I am sure I can use time wiser. I just need to adopt different identity for a moment. 

10:17 am 

again I was hoping for a quiet day to put work where it matters, but being bombarded by random requests. Just got irritated by Erick for not having documentation yet. Something must be unclear. does he consider it minor? Decided to put off that fight to tomorrow as I know him and Ben are working on the issue. Plus with Obsidian seems to be hard to make proposals & receive feedback... 

Okay, I am going to make a choice to not overreact. Stick to my plan and take things slow.

IT SHOULD NOT BE CHAOS. 

There is no need for that at all. 


#### End of day thoughts
Core too tired after workout to do my *back exercises today*

Started reading about Aboriginal tennis player *Goolagong*. 
Oh Australia, you are beautiful and messy.
