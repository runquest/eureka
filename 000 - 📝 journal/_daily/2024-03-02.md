#### Thoughts

It was a disappointing day yesterday work wise. 
I am going to make some changes. 
-
Dinner at *Sula* with Rachel and 2 hours of Mario Karts last night was a blast. 
-
My pain Level is a good indication on how my body does with no alcohol and less food. 
-


So what is the plan now? 

What do I have going on?

- *Sounding Board* - what can I do with it
- *Jobs* - gonna aim for Engineering Manager or Director of Engineering. Anything that offers healthy work hours and healthy salary. 
- *VTA* - what do I want from this? 


Fuck it. I want a comfortable life. I want to have sauna and gym. I want to have cleaners and not to think about flight tickets, car rentals, hotel prices, or if I spent too much on clothes. 

-> I want to apply this creative mindset of if you are given $1,000 or $10,000 or $100,000

I used to want to study, read, but how about building, teaching, connecting.
