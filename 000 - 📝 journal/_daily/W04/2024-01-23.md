#### Thoughts
Very sore after yesterday's tennis. 
But mood is good and energy feels high. 

*4:33 PM*
Felt like a full day.
4 meetings - DevSync, Gene, Illuminati & Kobalt.
Why it felt so busy?

All of those meeting required my full attention. All of those meetings needs thought, leadership and supervision. 

I felt like I hit the wall, just a minute ago, when I tried to "generate" demo client on the production account. A feature I really do not subscribe to. The feature that I do not think was properly thought out. I feature that I do not know on whose plate it should have landed to be fully flushed out. 

There are Epics that I am working on, because... Because I believe it will help the organization, because it will give me confidence and sense of being organized - 

***Product documentation***
Making team document implementation

***Improving our Product & Engineering workflows***
Planning, implementation, productivity, signs of something going out place.

***HIPAA Compliance: Security & Privacy***
Getting all of our processes & procedures organized

I am a bit spinning between those three - not feeling seen.... not feeling productive. 
I need to revisit "the whys" and "the end goals" for the projects.
