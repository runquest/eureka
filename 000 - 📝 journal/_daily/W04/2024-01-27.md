### Tasks 


- 2,000 calorie day - of nutritious intake
	I am sure I ate more than this. But I am glad I manage to keep a bottle of wine unopened. 
- 45 - 60 minutes cardio session
	- Not today. Too much in pain. Walk was my exercise
	- Throwing Abby around definitely was not a good idea. 
- [x] 10,000 steps 
	- Did not get to 10K, but above 6K. Again one of those wins where I could have chosen to lay on the ground and not move. Go get wine and drink a bottle. But I chose to walk in the pooring rain. #win
- [x] Connection with human
	- Hanged out with Vil, Taryn, Abby & Sheila 
	- Did cold dip into the ocean
	- Chatted with mom who was in a very good mood
- Reading of non-fiction
