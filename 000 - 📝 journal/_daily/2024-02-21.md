#### Thoughts

One can trip and fall. But it is how quick you can get up and start moving again. 
I know. The knowledge will not go away. When you know you know and there is no going back. 
But it is like living with a chronic pain, you will need to adapts, find ways to do things differently, try not to trigger it, develop system. 

Get busy? For the sake of being busy. Yeah, probably. And it's okay. Maybe in busy you can find solitude and flow. 
Get organized, dress well, exercise, read, learn, share, elevate.
