### Journal
#### Morning thoughts
Very angry this morning. Need *me* time and space. 
I am mostly frustrated that I am making no progress on personal goals - sounding board and australia. 
And I am making no progress because I am starting to doubt it all. 

It's okay. Took sometime to myself. Went to work to a coffee shop for a few hours. It helped a bit. 
Disappointment and desire to have a drink it is still there and very strong.
