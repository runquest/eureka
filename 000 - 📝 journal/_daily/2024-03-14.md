#### Thoughts

Today I am going to take everything slow. 
Debug & unblock Andrew; 
Fix Xukun's VPN. 
Give Erick access to AWS account. 
Release mobile app removing 90 day countdown. 
Get Matt's offer + approved.
Get Nova license. 
Vendor QC sign-off error. 
Delete users that requested. 
Do the release. 
Remove DevOps group from Main account
Help Matt add Route53 domains

What annoys me? 
The bugs coming to me...
The VPN fix coming to me...

The rest is I think okay. 

How do we get rid of those I cannot access my providers/admin/client portal requests. 
Do we need better visibility in what is going on? 

Does team have the right attitude on this?
