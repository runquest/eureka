### Evening thoughts

Workouts are still not my priority... I still cannot find time or space to fit them in. Why?!
Slept in till 7am. rushed to work for meetings. Full day of meetings. 
walked home. cooked dinner. played poker & watched tv. 
Spend time on *sounding board* landing page. 
Now it is 10:30pm and I did not find neither time nor motivation to spent even 10 minutes on movement... 
fail.
