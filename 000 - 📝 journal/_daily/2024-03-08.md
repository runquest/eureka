#### Thoughts
I am a writer. I am a thinker. 

I spent three days in VIPSS this week. Three long worthwhile days and cybersecurity and privacy summit. What did I walk away with. 

Well, to begin with, this was my first real world introduction in how industry functions, how it all works, what is the expectation and what are the philosophies surrounding it. Everything from super practical approaches of PII Data Vault, to high level of C-26 Bill introduction and modification. 

I am going to do deepdive into [[VIPSS2024 - Notes]]
