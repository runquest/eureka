#### Thoughts

I am hoping that fight and flight will be over.
Which probably will not be until we are in a steady situation.  

Let it go Aiste. Let it be. 
You cannot control universe, you can do the best you can.
You do not know what you do not know. 
Your only job is to orchestrate life around you that will give you an opportunity with integrity, respect and joy. 

I know it is hard to focus these days, but you are actually doing quite a good job at that. 
Let's aim to close, complete and tie a few lose knots and from there I need you get going building new things. 


What are all those things that you want to do?
