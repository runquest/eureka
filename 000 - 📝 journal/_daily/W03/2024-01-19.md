#### Thoughts

**8 am**
Magic number 7. 7 am wake up. 7 hours of sleep. Level of pain is 7. And 7 minutes of writing puts me in the zone. 
Seven. Magic number. 
I cleaned kitchen last night. Reorganized items.

**9:30 am**
For a purpose of demonstrating how distracted I get. Did not last 7 minutes at 8 am. 

This morning's conversation I will need to break into 3 different pieces - body pain, work tasks/strategies, and other.
I am even going to open a tab with open screen to write out all the unrelated thoughts.

*Body pain*
It's been too long. I feel every January is a reset. But my reset started last July, after the visit to an emergency room. 
Tennis match the night before was the last high intensity workout that I completed. 


*Work strategies & tasks*
