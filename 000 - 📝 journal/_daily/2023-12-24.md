### Journal

It does not feel authentic this note. It feels task oriented note. It restricts journaling. Maybe journaling is completely separate note. 

What are you trying to achieve at all? 

Well I want to improve a few areas of my life: 

1) I want to get back playing tennis pain free
2) I want to have Sounding Board up and running

Each of them require being on top of the game, and sometimes just going through motions. 

So what are you saying? That you need to keep track of certain activities - to make sure they are not pushed to a side. Say pain, sleep, alcohol, workouts. 
I feel workouts should not only be tracked but planned too. 

Where does deep thinking come in?

Thoughts

```d2
direction: right
aiste -> vta
aiste -> my
aiste -> sb
aiste -> daily
```


How do we get organized? 
I have projects?
