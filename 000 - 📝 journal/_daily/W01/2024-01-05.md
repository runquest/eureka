### Journal

Had pretty extensive *Roadmap meeting*. Lots of conversation about legal reimbursement issues. I understood half of it.
We conversed on OKRs. i took lead on People's OKR. - not sure it is a good thing.... there's a doubt that I will get enough input. I do not think people think it is important. Really need to think if it is something necessary. 

Skyler and I talked with Tyler. Conversation was really good. 
Proposed Gene - that we bring Tyler for 2 months to help Vlad cover all the technical debt and make little change to team. we decided to wonder on that a bit. Not sure it is the right way to go. 

Demo day went well. Though a tad boring. 
We decided not to allow any presentations.
