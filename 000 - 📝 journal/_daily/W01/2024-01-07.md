### Journal
#### Morning thoughts

#### **End of day thoughts**

Spent morning at Lindsay's  talking talking through Sounding Board. 
Lunch with Morgan. 

Did not feel energized by any of those hangouts :(
But forward movement. Update website. 
I really need lindsay not to focus on designs, and words. It is about putting things out into the world and seeing what clicks.

Went for a walk. Lindsay to a part of great [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWqzZ3I2cY).

Take aways:

- Building infrastructure makes world richer
- Blue Ocean - the most decisive company in the world
- For innovation you need to wonder
	- if you are trying to solve a problem you cannot put time limit on the meeting. If you do that you probably have an answer.
