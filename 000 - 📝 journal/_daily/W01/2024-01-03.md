### Journal
#### Morning thoughts

Pain during the day for the back seems to go up and down. From reading a book yesterday I should make a list during the day that makes back feel better or worse. However from reading it - I am pretty clear that the answer is strengthening my core.

Struggled to fall asleep last night scrolling through a crap shoot of youtube short videos. I need a better way to close out the day. I think I was still wired after my day.

The day yesterday felt a bit like a fight... I do not know why? It felt that was too passionate about things. Maybe starting with leadership meeting was not the best way to go, but if it is done well, why that not be my favorite thing? Okay, sure "they", did not do it well. How did your own meetings go?

12:05 I have headache today. Feel like it started yesterday on the couch reading the book and it is carrying over.

#### End of day thoughts
