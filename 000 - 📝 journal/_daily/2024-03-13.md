#### Thoughts

*Is there something that I should pay more attention/know that I am not at the moment?*
It got me scared. I was in panicking. I could not figure out what to say. How to say it. The words got stuck in my throat and I did not know how to express it. 
There is something big there sitting. Something big. I just do not know what it is yet.
