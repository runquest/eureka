#### Thoughts

What's the point?
If I learn that I have 6 months to live, I wanna die today. -Aiste

I just cannot define a reason to be alive. 
That's why for me it is so important to be useful, to be there for people, to be the person that you call in the middle of the night, the place where people come if they in doubt of where to go. 

Maybe it is current comfort of living. 
I am curious just about the things that make me think, makes me want to understand. 
But even that I find a distraction from a fact that there is no point. We are born and we die. And everything in between is survival. Survival in many ways - from physical comfort, to internal entertainment.
Survival of living through fear of losing, through search of *the right* choice, through living with grief, shame and guilt. 

Dreams... Living seem either monotonous or selfish. If it is not a sacrifice it is selfish. And why is selfish bad?
Because we are not alone in this world. 

One can be a stepping stone or a hand that pulls you up.

you could think that sharing of joy would make other happy, but again it does not - it makes you happy - unless the experience is shared.

Winny the Poo & Piglet in their adventures. 
Dreamer and supporter. 
As much as i loved their story I felt annoyed by Winny who did not see Piglet. 
And I felt sorry for Piglet who seem to always make sacrifices for Winnies stupidity. 

Something is not working, but I do not know if anything ever worked. 
There were moments where I just forgot. It feels that there were moments where I just forgot that life is pointless. 

I know it matters than. I will need to pull through from this *down* moment. I will need to climb mountain again, to see the sun and forget how dark it is on the shores of the lake. 
I know. 

Can meaning come and go?
Surrender. 
Trust. 
Be you.

Be me... 
Who am I if I do not know where I am going?
I am me in every moment inspite of what I portrait?

Dream...
Are you tired. 
Sure. 
I am tired and I am in pain. 
But is it really what I craving is just someone to pull over curtains when the moon is too bright at night. 

Sure there will be sad people when I go, but really...
If we all are just playing soccer and I just do not see the point in all of us running after the ball..
What if all of us are just playing for a beautiful pass, nice goal, inventive dribble. 
I am just done. I am just bored. 

Go build your own team?
Learn something?
Why? 

Redundancy. 

Do people really not think the same way? 
Do they ignore that fact, does that not cross their mind?

I feel like I am standing in a field and I am looking around, while others either have their sight on a mountain peak in the distance, or looking down and enjoying every step, and feeling every rock and every breaze. 

Something is working. This Matrix.

It's really just that - I will need to find a way to distract myself again from empty. 

Space. Big space. No boundaries. 
Carve your own. Why? that I could protect, share or regret of losing? 
And I am still scared and helpless. 

It is not that others need me. I need them. I call them cause I want to know that I matter, it's not that they need me... This illusion. 
That is why I give priority to everyone else. It is not them needing me, it is me needing them to say that my being here matters.
