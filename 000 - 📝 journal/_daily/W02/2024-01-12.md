### Journal
#### Morning thoughts

It is a very cold morning. Arctic wave or what not. My thighs are still defrosting after walk to the office. 
Today I am back being wrapped up in an idea of getting body into a fighting shape. 
Athletes ten to come back from such blows and focus and train, how is it that it has been 6 months, and my state is give or take the same. 
Consistency?
