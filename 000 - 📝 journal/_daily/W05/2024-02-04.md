#### Thoughts

Body feels today much better than I was expecting after spending day with Abby. 
Not sure what to contribute it to - yesterday's morning movement exploration, cold dip, minimal time on the couch or in front of the screen or the consistency of exercises finally showing it's results. 
Today I am feeling upper body quite intensely - carrying Abby is heavy... strength and endurance seems to be lacking. Sleeping neck feels out of place a bit, maybe a new pillow or maybe neck strengthening exercises. 
I will see if I can get bath today. 

No bath but shared sboard.ca website with LinkedIn community. Step 1 - complete. Now what is Step 2?
