#### Thoughts

Spend an hour this morning exploring the body.
Started with a simple stick man diagram with indications of my trauma, and tight spots. Breaking it down into areas I need to work in. 
Searching and outlining exercises I believe will help my rehabilitation.

Did a cold dip with Taryn & Vil on English Bay. 
It was chilly and neither of us wanted to go.
But neither of us waffled. While we all chatted how silly it is and how we may not wanna do - neither of us stood there contemplating this option.

Stripped, slowly walked to the water, 1-2-3 - breath in and dive under the water, and then walk out. 

The moment of getting my head under the water is so vivid. I have a momentary fear. Then I have this out of body experience of seeing my head submerging the water. This cold and fresh and lightness fills up and I exit. I am still struggling to understand why is it scary. And why we *just do it*?
