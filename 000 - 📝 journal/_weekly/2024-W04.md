### Summarize it all in 1 sentence
Stay in control. No need for emotions and daily emptiness take over. 
I am living life I choose to live. 
My choice is to turn on TV, poor glass of wine, grab another cookie, sit on the couch, make family, friends, relationships a priority. 
No I do not think that Rachel and I are happy. 
I do think we are fully capable of making our lives much more meaningful, fun and happily exciting. 
We are incredibly good combo. We are both are suffering mediocrity that we created for ourselves. We are both scared. We are trying little things, each at our own time and it just hit huge misalignments and we do not know how to propel each other forward. 
But I truly believe in both of us. 
We can move past it. 
We can learn. 
We are both stubborn. 
We both love and respect each other. 
We are gonna show up for each other.
