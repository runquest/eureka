Pain average: 4, 5.5, 5.5, 7, 7, 7, 5 = 5.9
Notes: I think average is quite fair assessment. Monday's 4 was certainly given at the end of the day after Maria's appointment. And does not reflect reality. Pain of 7 may be a bit more than it felt, but than some moment 5.5 is not accurate throughout the day. But yes average of 6ish is about right.
