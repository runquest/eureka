#### Thoughts

Good morning. 
Obviously missed a note for yesterday, oh well. 

Yesterday was a busy day... I am too much in my thoughts and at the moment I think I am running too fast with little plan. With the ambition & ego and imposter syndrome.
Too many conversations. Too much criticism. I need some grounding principles. We want co-creation. 
What does Brene say - Either do it, help it or ... I forget that *or*

I am mostly functioning from frustration, that things are not going how are they supposed to. 
Are they going that way for you? 
Can recenter on you? Can you see what you need to keep functioning well? 

Body is still in so much pain. But Haiyan's comment yesterday - that it may not be 3-6 month project. It may be 2-3 year project. Kinda reached me. Almost allowed me the space. 
While i still want to experience relief of this pain, I believe I am gonna be returning to all fitness activities progressively. Starting this month, with all the mobility & rehab stuff. 
Another thing too. Let's not make it 7 days a week. Can we make it 3 days a week? That seems more doable. But mobility - feels like it needs daily exposure, otherwise how much change do I actually make?

I feel 7 - 10ish is my most productive time, when I can focus and think. How am I giving away that time for walks, workouts, or conversation. 

Breath... slow... my brain is still speeding. 

Such a wonderful time last night with Rachel at Espana on Denman. Food was good, but nothing to write home about, however the atmosphere was vibrant active, cozy and communal and private. Incredibly pleasant place. We would definitely go back for some personal time. 

But by the time I got home I was exhausted.

For work the most immediate projects that I want to complete:
- Clear plan / roadmap for Security & Privacy team - I am 50% there. 
	- Request 4 PenTest offers
	- How do we do Risk Assessment
	- Threat Modelling Habits
	- Certain standards - again take templates
- Knowledge platform & documentation
	- Deploy to S3
	- Create GitHub actions for deployment
	- 

On a side note I also I need to review 
* Jira board
* Prepare for Dev + Product sync up meeting
