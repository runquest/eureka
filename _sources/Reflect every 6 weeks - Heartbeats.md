Heartbeats summarize the last ~6-weeks of work for a given team, department, or individual (if that person is a department of one).

They're written by the lead of the group, and they're meant for everyone in the company to read.

They summarize the big picture accomplishments, they detail the little things that mattered, and they generally highlight the importance of the work.

They'll also shine a light on challenges and difficulties along the way.

They're a good reminder that it's not all sunshine all the time. On balance, Heartbeats are wonderful to write, fun to read, and they help everyone - including those not directly involved with the work - reflect on jobs well done and progress well made.
