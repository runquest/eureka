"Tech Trees" or "technology trees" are a design element commonly found in strategy games, both video and board games, which represent the progression and branching pathways of technological development that players can pursue. These trees often visually resemble a tree, with branches representing different paths that technologies can evolve through over time.

In the context of video games, especially in genres like real-time strategy (RTS) and turn-based strategy (TBS), a tech tree allows players to research and develop new technologies, units, buildings, or abilities. The progression through a tech tree can unlock new options and strategies for the player, often requiring them to make choices about which technologies to pursue with their limited resources. This can lead to different outcomes or advantages in the game, depending on the player's choices and their opponent's strategies.

Tech trees can vary widely in complexity and depth, from simple linear progressions to complex networks of interdependent technologies that require strategic planning and prioritization to navigate effectively. They add a layer of strategic depth to games, encouraging players to plan ahead and make decisions that will affect their development and capabilities in the game.

In broader terms, the concept of a "tech tree" can also be applied to real-world technological development, illustrating how different innovations and discoveries lead to further advancements and new branches of technology. However, in most contexts, when people refer to tech trees, they are talking about their application in gaming.

## Example

A classic example of a tech tree can be found in the "Civilization" series of video games, developed by Sid Meier. In these turn-based strategy games, players lead a civilization from the dawn of humanity into the future, competing against other civilizations to become the dominant global power through various means such as military conquest, cultural influence, or scientific advancement.

The tech tree in "Civilization" is a fundamental aspect of the game's strategy and progression. It visually represents the technological advancements available to a civilization, structured in a branching path where certain technologies unlock the prerequisites for others. For instance:

1. **Ancient Technologies:** The game typically starts in the Ancient Era, where players can research basic technologies like Pottery, which might lead to Writing, and then to the development of Libraries or Schools, enhancing a civilization's science output.

2. **Medieval to Renaissance Technologies:** As the game progresses, players move through different historical eras, each with its own set of technologies to research. For example, after researching Education (a Medieval technology), players can unlock Universities, which significantly boost scientific research, leading to Renaissance technologies like Printing Press and Astronomy.

3. **Modern and Future Technologies:** In the later stages of the game, players can unlock modern and futuristic technologies, such as Computers, which may lead to the Internet, or Satellites, unlocking Spaceflight. These technologies can enable advanced military units, improve infrastructure, or contribute to a Science Victory by completing the space race.

Each technology on the tree has specific requirements and often requires the player to have researched previous technologies. This creates strategic depth, as players must choose which technologies to prioritize based on their desired victory condition, their civilization's strengths, and their competitors' actions.

The tech tree in "Civilization" encourages players to think strategically about the long-term development of their civilization, balancing immediate needs with future benefits. It's a dynamic system that allows for diverse strategies and outcomes, making each playthrough unique.
