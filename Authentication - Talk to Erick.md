### Errors / Changes
- we should separate where it is wrong password and where it is locked account
- why on profile I cannot see my email address anywhere?
- it should matter which vendor - they need to switch profile

- Onboard: cannot change my dark/light mode.
- In dark mode poor txt visibility
- Lack of gap between search and map
- hitting on Logo should return me to the starting point

- why do I get this "You are already signed in." flash message? I literally just signed in...
- if I clear the input box - error should go away
- back button is inconsistency - sometimes big - sometimes small, sometimes does not exist at all.
