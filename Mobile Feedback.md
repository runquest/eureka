Is this a lot? What is it vs. web? vs. new reports? 
Tells me little about client. 

> Current users can keep the app without any changes

Kinda. But not really? We need to do a new release to remove onboarding. And any new improvements/vulnerabilities will require application upgrade. So we need to account for at least +/- FT / month.

> User experience may not feel smooth, having to jump between platforms

What assumption are you making here? That we are having onboarding on web and report on mobile? What the assumption would be to keep both web/mobile aligned and have feature parity? Would that change your mind about keeping it?

> Report is accessible regardless of what platform user is on

This is actually already true. Mobile is definitely much more granule.

> More streamlined user flow by being able to use one device for the entire flow

Again this is already true if you are downloading PDF for your report.

> If we would like to integrate biometric data (step counts, heart rate, etc.) into the report in the future, that will be challenging

Well we could solve it via Integrations and APIs with other applications. Either on mobile or on web we will need user permission to track that data anyways...

What is the set of "features" you are expected to transfer?
